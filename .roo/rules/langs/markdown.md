# Markdown Formatting Guidelines

## 1. Guiding Principle: Simplicity

The PRIMARY goal when writing Markdown is to keep the formatting simple, clear, and consistent. Avoid complex Markdown syntax where simpler alternatives exist. The raw Markdown should be as readable as the rendered output.

## 2. Emphasis

- EMPHASIS METHOD: To emphasize important words or phrases, write them in UPPER CASE. This method should be used to denote significance.
- DISCOURAGED PRACTICES: Excessive use of **bold** (`**word**` or `__word__`) or *italics* (`*word*` or `_word_`) for emphasis is discouraged. Use them sparingly, for their traditional grammatical purposes (e.g., titles of works for italics).
  - Bold and italics should NOT be used as a replacement for proper heading structure or UPPER CASE emphasis.

## 3. Lists

- PREFERRED STYLE: Use traditional bullet point lists with hyphens (`-`) for unordered lists. Be consistent within a single document or section. Hyphens (`-`) are generally preferred for top-level lists.
  - A SINGLE space should follow the list marker (e.g., `- item` not `-   item`).
    ```markdown
    - First item
    - Second item
      - Sub-item 1 (indented with two spaces)
      - Sub-item 2
    - Third item
    ```
- NUMBERED LISTS: Use standard numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`).

## 4. Horizontal Rules

- Use three hyphens (`---`) on a line by themselves. Be consistent.
